// Encodes a batch of PNG textures to WebP. Invoked once per run by the C# item-generator
// (AssetProcessor.ProcessMaterialTextures) with a JSONL manifest of jobs. Output bytes feed the
// content hashes embedded in CDN filenames, so sharp is pinned exact and nothing here may change
// encoded bytes. Constraints:
// - Every job takes the same lossy VP8 encode; there are no lossless or near-lossless paths.
//   See Config.WebpQuality for what that costs and why the carve-outs were not worth it.
// - `exact` must stay on: 9,422 textures (2.4 GB) still carry a genuine varying alpha with
//   fully-transparent pixels, and shader logic reads the RGB underneath. Dropping alpha where
//   the game format has none did not retire this — it only removed the fabricated planes.
//   Turning `exact` off saves 0.43% on exactly those files while raising their max RGB error
//   under alpha=0 from 49 to 147 (measured, q95, 25-texture sample).
// - `dropAlpha` marks a texture whose game format has no alpha channel, so the exported one is
//   ValveResourceFormat's invention. Nothing may be chained after `removeAlpha()`: sharp orders
//   its pipeline internally, not by call order, and puts `resize` FIRST — so `.removeAlpha()
//   .resize()` still premultiplies against the alpha we are removing. On the BC5 normals, whose
//   fabricated alpha is 0 rather than 255, that zeroes the whole image (measured: 68.6 MB of
//   normals encode to 0.00 MB). Any future resize step has to run as its own pass.
